dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles repo with almost all my preferences (i hope, i'll find time to create Sublime preferences package).


Install
-------

First of all, you should install [Vundle for vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

Clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:eXiga/dotfiles.git
```
Run rakefile

```
cd dotfiles
rake install
```

**Be careful, it will delete _all_ your dotfiles with the same name**

Voila, you've just installed my dotfiles.

Contribution
------------

There are several things I want to add in this repo:

* ~~Auto-installing Vundle~~
* ~~Creating backups~~
* Maybe add some OOP features in rakefile

If you want to help me - you are welcome! Just create a feature and notify me with a pull-request.
