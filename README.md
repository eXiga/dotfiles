dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles repo. 


Install
-------


Clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:eXiga/dotfiles.git
```

TODO: idk if I should do it, but it'd be nice to have some script

~Run rakefile~


~**Be careful, it will delete _all_ your dotfiles with the same name**~

~**It will create .dfbackup folder in your $HOME directory with all backups**~

~Voila, you've just installed my dotfiles.~
